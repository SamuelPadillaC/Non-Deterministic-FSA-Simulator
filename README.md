# Non-Deterministic-FSA-Simulator
This is a simulator of a Non-Deterministic Finite State Automaton
The program simulates a non-deterministic automaton and analyzes input words determining if they are part of the language (if they are valid) or not.
See the description.pdf to understand the format.

########################################################################
# Must-Knows & Pre-reqs
These are things you must know to understand the program:
1. Understand what a Finite State Automaton is and how it functions.
2. Understand what a Non-Deterministic Finite State Automaton is and how it functions.
3. Understand how the analysis of words works for NFSAs

########################################################################
# To Run the program:
1. Download the repository in a machine with Python installed.
2. Run the script from the command line using "python Simulator.py"
3. Pass in the proper arguments as listed below

# Note
This program uses Pandas and Numpy (it was just practice for me), so it must be necessary that you install those packages in your environment.
Just run pip install pandas & pip install numpy and you should be good to go.

########################################################################
# Arguments - Simulator.py receives 3 command line arguments in the following order:
# A Definition File

This Definition File configures the Machine, following the format instructions specified in the Description file (description.pdf).
# An Input file name

This file contains a series of words that the machine will analyze. This file follows the format instructions specified in the Description file (description.pdf).
# The output file name 

This file will be created as the output of the analysis of every line. It outputs according to the format instructions specified in the Description file (description.pdf).
